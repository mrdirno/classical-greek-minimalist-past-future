  "cover_prompt": "A solitary woman in a simple chiton stands within a vast, geometric sanctuary carved from white marble and dark basalt, her hands resting on a colossal, perfectly smooth sphere that emerges from the rough-hewn floor, symbolizing the tension between human order and raw nature. The scene is set within a vast, hypostyle hall of towering, minimalist Doric columns under a cavernous ceiling, where creeping vines and geometric shadows from unseen light sources create a living pattern of discipline and wild growth, evoking a future where classical architecture has been reclaimed by the earth. In the stark, atmospheric style of Giorgio de Chirico's metaphysical paintings and the serene, monumental emptiness of Hiroshi Sugimoto's seascapes, rendered with the precise, luminous detail of a large format photograph. Book cover framing, centered and symmetrical composition with a dramatic low-angle shot looking up at the figure and the sphere, emphasizing scale and awe. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with sharp, long shadows and a single, strong raking light source, casting deep geometric patterns, within a restrained color palette of bone white marble, cool grey basalt, muted terracotta, and the deep green of resilient moss. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev"
