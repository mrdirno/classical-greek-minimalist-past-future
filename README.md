## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Elara must teach the discipline to a new, resistant arrival.
- Describe a day in the life of Kyna before she came to the island.
- Create a myth or parable that Silenus might tell without words, using only objects in the garden.
- Write the moment, years later, when Elara first breaks a rule of the askēsis and speaks out of turn.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a text-based simulation of the garden, where resource management (water, seed, effort) must be balanced against the 'noise' of emotional states.
- Create a minimalist UI/visualizer that translates the novel's prose into interactive geometric forms and soundscapes based on sentence structure and thematic keywords.
